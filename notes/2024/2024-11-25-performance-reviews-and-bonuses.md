    > IBM: “You’d write in your goals at the beginning of the year, and at the end of the year, your manager would give you feedback and your rating,” Gherson says. “We threw all that out.”
    > the essential insight remains: Team performance is not merely a sum or aggregate of individual performances. Team performance — and the dynamics of interpersonal interaction between teams and coaches alike — requires dedicated data and analytics.

- assessments are in many cases perceived as being procedurally unfair in terms of the Folger and Bies (1989) criteria. Inadequate consideration is given to employee views; there is evidence of bias, inconsistency, poorly justified feedback and a lack of honesty in the process.

# Performance bonuses
Shortly: difficult to manage, very short-term positive impact, a much bigger long-term negative factor.

As soon as you give a bonus, the focus of people’s attention immediately shifts from the work in its entirety to the achievement of the (inevitably reduced) indicator or result for which the bonus is given. Thus the system becomes unbalanced.

It’s much cooler to “turn off” money from people’s attention in general, that is, just pay well and index regularly - then people will be able to show real internal motivation to work with full dedication.

The negative factor when we see people think the bonus was not fair is much higher.
