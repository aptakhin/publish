# Terraform #terraform #azure

After accidental dropping of database we need to restore previous state in the terraform

CreateÂ `backend_override.tf`:

```tf
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "rg-...-terraform"
    storage_account_name = "storage_account"
    container_name       = "container"
    key                  = "terraform.tfstate"
  }
}
```

And then list resources one by one with the import helm in current documentation.

```bash
terraform import -var="environment_name=prd" -var="organization=${ORGANIZATION}" -var="database_admin_password=xxxxxxxx" azurerm_storage_account.storage /subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_KEY}/resourceGroups/${RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/stprdprocessing${ORGANIZATION}

```

One trick:

> The Azure API's are supposed to be case-insensitive during reads and case-sensitive during responses with particular values

From [https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/issues/19600](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/issues/19600)

So sometimes it's required to lowercase some IDs.
